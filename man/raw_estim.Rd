\title{Estimate mean, SD, and autocorrelation of sample noise.}
\usage{
raw_estim(noise)
}
\arguments{
\item{noise}{The vector of random numbers.}
}
\value{
A labeled vector with the sample mean, sample SD, and sample
  autocorrelation.
}
\description{
This function estimates the temporal autocorrelation of a vector of random
numburs, as well as the sample mean and standard deviation. Try feeding it the output of \code{\link{raw_noise}}.

\examples{
rednoise <- raw_noise(timesteps = 30, mu = 0.5, sigma = 0.2, phi = 0.3)
raw_estim(rednoise)
