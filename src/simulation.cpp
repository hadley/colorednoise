//' Simulated Time Series of an Unstructured Temporally Autocorrelated Population
//'
//' This function simulates an unstructured population with
//' temporally autocorrelated vital rates (survival and fertility). In other
//' words, this function will show you the dynamics over time of a population
//' whose survival and fertility is stochastic, but also correlated to the
//' survival and fertility in the previous year, respectively. The assumptions of the
//' simulation are that the population is asexually reproducing or female-only,
//' survival and fertility are the same at all ages / stages,
//' and that individuals continue to be reproductively capable until they die.
//'
//' Be advised that not all combinations of values will work. If you set survival and
//' fertility unrealistically high, the population size will tend toward infinity and
//' the simulation will fail because the numbers are too large to handle. Use your
//' common sense as a demographer / population biologist.
//' @import stats
//' @param start The starting population size.
//' @param timesteps The number of timesteps you want to simulate. Individuals
//'   are added and killed off every timestep according to the survival and
//'   fertility rates. In ecological applications, timesteps are usually years,
//'   but theoretically they can be any length of time.
//' @param survPhi The temporal autocorrelation of survival. 0 is white noise (uncorrelated),
//'   positive values are red noise (directly correlated) and negative values are
//'   blue noise (inversely correlated).
//' @param fecundPhi The temporal autocorrelation of fecundity. As above.
//' @param survMean The mean survival from timestep to timestep. Must be a value
//'   between 0 (all individuals die) and 1 (all individuals live).
//' @param survSd The standard deviation of the survival from timestep to
//'   timestep. Must be a value between 0 and 1.
//' @param fecundMean The mean fertility: mean offspring produced by each individual per timestep.
//' @param fecundSd The standard deviation of the fertility.
//' @return A data frame with four variables: timestep, population (total individuals
//'   alive at the start of the timestep), newborns (new individuals
//'   born this timestep), and survivors (individuals who survive this timestep).
