## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.4.2
* win-builder (devel)

## R CMD check results

There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. 

There was 1 NOTE in the win-builder R CMD check:

* Possibly mis-spelled words in DESCRIPTION:
  Autocorrelated (3:28)
  autocorrelated (9:25, 9:226)
  autocorrelation (10:90, 10:137, 10:189)
  
  These words are not misspelled; autocorrelation is a common technical term in my field.
  
* Another NOTE should arise due to the fact that this is my first submission to CRAN.
