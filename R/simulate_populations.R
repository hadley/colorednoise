#' Simulate a time series of a temporally autocorrelated population
#'
#' The backbone of this package, this function simulates a population with
#' temporally autocorrelated vital rates (survival and fertility). In other
#' words, this function will show you the dynamics over time of a population
#' whose survival and fertility is stochastic, but also correlated to the
#' survival and fertility in the previous year. The assumptions of the
#' simulation are that the population is asexually reproducing or female-only,
#' individuals are able to reproduce in their first timestep, survival and
#' fertility are the same at all ages, in every timestep they either produce 0
#' or 1 offspring, and that individuals continue to be reproductively capable
#' until they die.
#' @import stats
#' @param start The starting population size.
#' @param timesteps The number of timesteps you want to simulate. Individuals
#'   are added and killed off every timestep according to the survival and
#'   fertility rates. In ecological applications, timesteps are usually years,
#'   but theoretically they can be any length of time.
#' @param phi The temporal autocorrelation. 0 is white noise (uncorrelated),
#'   positive values are red noise (directly correlated) and negative values are
#'   blue noise (inversely correlated).
#' @param survMean The mean survival from timestep to timestep. Must be a value
#'   between 0 (all individuals die) and 1 (all individuals live).
#' @param survSd The standard deviation of the survival from timestep to
#'   timestep. Must be a value between 0 and 1.
#' @param fecundMean The mean fertility. Must be a number from 0 (no one
#'   reproduces) to 1 (everyone reproduces).
#' @param fecundSd The standard deviation of the fertility. Must be a number
#'   from 0 to 1.
#' @return A data frame with five variables: timestep, newborns (new individuals
#'   added this timestep), survivors (individuals alive last year who survived
#'   this timestep), population (total individuals alive), and growth (the
#'   increase or decrease in population size from last year).

#' Simulate temporally autocorrelated populations for every combination of
#' parameters
#'
#' Essentially a loop of \code{\link{timeseries}}, this function simulates a
#' population with temporally autocorrelated vital rates for every combination
#' of parameters you specify, with as many replicates as desired. It also
#' estimates the sample mean survival and fertility for each simulated
#' population. Please be advised that this function can be very computationally
#' intensive if you provide many possible parameter values and/or ask for many
#' replicates.
