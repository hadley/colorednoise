#' Generate Autocorrelated Noise
#'
#' This function generates temporally autocorrelated random numbers with a mean,
#' standard deviation, and autocorrelation you specify.
#' @param timesteps The number of temporally autocorrelated random numbers (one
#'   per timestep) you want.
#' @param mu The mean of the temporally autocorrelated random numbers.
#' @param sigma The standard deviation of the temporally autocorrelated random
#'   numbers.
#' @param phi The temporal autocorrelation. 0 is white noise (uncorrelated),
#'   positive values are red noise (directly correlated) and negative values are blue
#'   noise (inversely correlated).
#' @return A vector of temporally autocorrelated random numbers.
#' @examples
#' rednoise <- raw_noise(timesteps = 30, mu = 0.5, sigma = 0.2, phi = 0.3)
#' rednoise
#' @export
raw_noise <- function(timesteps, mu, sigma, phi) {
    .Call('_colorednoise_raw_noise', PACKAGE = 'colorednoise', timesteps, mu, sigma, phi)
}

variancefix <- function(mu, sigma, dist) {
    .Call('_colorednoise_variancefix', PACKAGE = 'colorednoise', mu, sigma, dist)

#' Simulated Time Series of an Unstructured Temporally Autocorrelated Population
#'
#' This function simulates an unstructured population with
#' temporally autocorrelated vital rates (survival and fertility). In other
#' words, this function will show you the dynamics over time of a population
#' whose survival and fertility is stochastic, but also correlated to the
#' survival and fertility in the previous year, respectively. The assumptions of the
#' simulation are that the population is asexually reproducing or female-only,
#' survival and fertility are the same at all ages / stages,
#' and that individuals continue to be reproductively capable until they die.
#'
#' Be advised that not all combinations of values will work. If you set survival and
#' fertility unrealistically high, the population size will tend toward infinity and
#' the simulation will fail because the numbers are too large to handle. Use your
#' common sense as a demographer / population biologist.
#' @import stats
#' @param start The starting population size.
#' @param timesteps The number of timesteps you want to simulate. Individuals
#'   are added and killed off every timestep according to the survival and
#'   fertility rates. In ecological applications, timesteps are usually years,
#'   but theoretically they can be any length of time.
#' @param survPhi The temporal autocorrelation of survival. 0 is white noise (uncorrelated),
#'   positive values are red noise (directly correlated) and negative values are
#'   blue noise (inversely correlated).
#' @param fecundPhi The temporal autocorrelation of fecundity. As above.
#' @param survMean The mean survival from timestep to timestep. Must be a value
#'   between 0 (all individuals die) and 1 (all individuals live).
#' @param survSd The standard deviation of the survival from timestep to
#'   timestep. Must be a value between 0 and 1.
#' @param fecundMean The mean fertility: mean offspring produced by each individual per timestep.
#' @param fecundSd The standard deviation of the fertility.
#' @return A data frame with four variables: timestep, population (total individuals
#'   alive at the start of the timestep), newborns (new individuals
#'   born this timestep), and survivors (individuals who survive this timestep).
#' @examples
#' series1 <- timeseries(start = 20, timesteps = 10, survPhi = 0.7, fecundPhi = -0.1, survMean = 0.6,
#' survSd = 0.52, fecundMean = 1.2, fecundSd = 0.7)
